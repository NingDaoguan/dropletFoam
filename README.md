dropletFoam
===========

Compressible, multiphase OpenFOAM combustion solver. 

This branch uses a PLIC interface reconstruction algorithm for fluid flow.


Status
================
PLIC scheme with refinement results in strange behavior of vapor entering fluid.

Phases are considered incompressible and only fluid flow is currently solved.

multiDropTest is the case that is currently breaking it.
